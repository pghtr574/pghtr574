If you're anything like me, then you're probably installing and uninstalling apps on a daily basis, which usually messes up all file associations in the system.
In that case, you can either repair them manually or run a program like Types.
This simple tool lists all the file types available in your system and helps you view and edit their associations with certain apps.
This means that, for instance, if you've always opened JPG images with XnView but this association has been taken over by another graphic editor, you can easily restore it with Types.
Plus, it doesn't even require installation.
Besides file associations, Types also lets you edit icons, context menu, properties, and other features of all file types shown in Windows Explorer.
On the downside, the program is not very easy to use and doesn't include any documentation either, so you better know what you're doing before editing anything.
Types can help you restore broken file associations in your system, though it may not be easy to use for a beginner.
